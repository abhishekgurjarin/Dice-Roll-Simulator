# Dice Roll Simulator Website
## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Today, I'm excited to share a project I recently completed: a **Dice Roll Simulator**. This project is a fun and interactive way to simulate the rolling of a dice, making it a great way to practice JavaScript, especially in the areas of DOM manipulation and event handling. Whether you're looking to build something playful or need a simple dice roll feature for a game, this project is a perfect start.

## Project Overview

The **Dice Roll Simulator** allows users to simulate the roll of a six-sided dice with a simple click of a button. The result is displayed in a visually appealing way, mimicking the appearance of a real dice. This project is perfect for developers who want to enhance their skills in building interactive web applications while working with animations and event listeners.

## Features

- **Dice Roll Simulation**: Users can roll a virtual dice by clicking a button, and the result is displayed instantly.
- **Roll History**: The application keeps a record of all previous rolls, allowing users to see the outcomes of their past rolls.
- **Animation**: The dice roll is accompanied by a smooth rotation animation to add realism to the simulation.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to work well across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content on the webpage.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the webpage and adding animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for handling the dice roll logic, updating the DOM, and managing animations.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekgurjarin/Dice-Roll-Simulator.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Dice-Roll-Simulator
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - You can either run it on a local server or simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Click the "Roll Dice" button** to simulate a dice roll.
3. **View the result** on the dice and check the roll history displayed below.
